## Introduction

In this project, we use SQL server to explore global COVID 19 data following the instruction of [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst).
The dataset used in this project is the dataset used in [Data Analyst Portfolio Project | SQL Data Exploration | Project 1/4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM), which included 2 excel files [Covid Deaths](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/CovidDeaths.xlsx) and [Covid Vaccinations](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/CovidVaccinations.xlsx) contain covid data from January 28 2020 to April 30 2021.
The used dataset originally from [Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths - Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
